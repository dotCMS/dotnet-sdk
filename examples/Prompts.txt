Can you create the following Model classes that can be used with the json response in the page-test.json?

We need a Model class for each of the following objects
- Template
- Layout
   - Row
      - Columns
      - Container
- Contentlet (can have arbitrary keys)
- Page (can include arbitrary keys)
- Site (can include arbitrary keys)
- View As
   - Visitor
   - geo
   - language
   

These needs to be placed in the Models folder
   

We need a catch-all controller that will accept all requests (except to URIs that start with `/dA`) and take that request and do web request to the dotCMS server specified in the `appsettings.json` dotCMS.ApiHost value.  It should call  the remote dotCMS instance /api/v1/page/json/${incomingURI} endpoint.    It should also include the ApiToken in the Authorization Bearer :header 

When it gets a response, it should automatically map that response to the PageResponse Model -  the api response will look like it does in the page-test.json file.


We want to show the site navigation in the header.  there is an api which needs to be called that will return the navigation tree that uses this endpoint: /api/v1/nav/?depth=4
the depth parameter is configurable and controls the depth of nav hierachy to return.  The api response looks like what is in the nav-result.json file.  
Can you add a method to the dotCMSService class to retreve the the results and build a drop down nav based on that?  This nav should be done in the header.cshtml 
file and should not use any framework or javascript libraries if possible, just css.
